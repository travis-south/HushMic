# Usage

## Launching

| command | what happens |
|---------|--------------|
| `hushmic` | tray icon plus the mic test window; a second launch reopens the window in the running instance |
| `hushmic --tray` | tray icon only; the autostart entry uses this |
| `hushmic --headless` | no icon, no window; see [headless.md](headless.md) |
| `hushmic --enable-once` | creates the virtual mic and waits for Ctrl+C; no watchdog, no CLI socket |
| `hushmic --doctor` | prints a diagnostics report and exits 1 when it finds problems |
| `hushmic --version` | version and install paths |

Only one instance runs per session. Quitting removes the virtual mic and restores the previous default input if HushMic had changed it.

## Modes

| mode | virtual mic carries |
|------|---------------------|
| `suppress` | your voice, cleaned |
| `bypass` | your raw voice, same latency |
| `mute` | silence |
| `off` | nothing; the virtual mic is removed |

Switching between suppress, bypass and mute changes a control on the running chain, so your call stays connected. Mute silences the virtual mic only; an app that captures the physical microphone directly still hears you.

The tray icon shows the state. On KDE and GNOME it is a monochrome icon in your panel's own color: a mic with noise going in and a clean line coming out while suppressing (on KDE its inside takes your accent color), a hollow mic in bypass, a mic struck through in red while muted, a faint mic when off, and a red warning badge on an error. Other desktops get the colored set: cyan while suppressing, gray in bypass, a red struck-through mic while muted, gray struck-through when off, and a warning badge on an error. The [`tray_icon`](#configuration) setting picks between the two, so `hushmic config set tray_icon color` brings the colored icons back on KDE and GNOME.

## Microphone, model and strength

**Microphone** lists the capture devices PipeWire sees. *System default* follows whatever the system default input is, including when you plug a headset in. If your chosen microphone disappears, HushMic falls back to the system default and switches back when it returns.

**Model**: `dpdfnet8_48khz_hr` is the quality model, `dpdfnet2_48khz_hr` needs less CPU. Changing the model restarts the chain (a short gap on the virtual mic).

**Suppression strength** caps how much noise is removed, in dB: maximum (100), strong (24), medium (12) or light (6). Lower values keep more of the room sound.

Model and strength are remembered per microphone. Pick a microphone under **Microphone** and change them: that microphone keeps its own settings from then on. Every microphone without its own settings shares the defaults (`model` and `attn_limit` in the file). A change goes to the settings in effect: the microphone's own when it has them, else the defaults. `hushmic status` says which. With *System default* selected, the settings follow the default input: when it moves to another microphone for longer than a few seconds, HushMic restarts with that microphone's settings (a short gap). If the default keeps switching back and forth, those restarts get further apart, up to five minutes. Bluetooth headsets can show up as a different device per audio profile (for example music and headset mode), and each one has its own settings.

With **Set as default microphone** on, HushMic is the default input and uses the microphone that was the default before. If you switch the system default to another microphone yourself, that switch stays: HushMic follows the new microphone with its settings and does not take the default back until you turn it on again (mode, the checkbox, or the next start).

## Test my mic

**Test my mic** in the menu opens a window with the raw microphone and the cleaned output side by side: scrolling spectrograms and level meters. It can also record a 10-second sample and play it back as *Play raw* and *Play filtered*, with measured before/after numbers. Without a display or GL, an audio-only record-and-playback test runs instead.

## Keyboard shortcuts

**Set up shortcuts…** in the menu opens your desktop's key-binding dialog for four actions: toggle mute, toggle bypass, push to talk (live only while held) and push to mute (silent while held). The compositor grabs the keys, so they work in any app. After the first setup the entry reads **Change shortcuts…** and opens the desktop's shortcut editor; the keys also show up in your system's keyboard settings.

On KDE Plasma before 6.4 (Kubuntu 24.04, Debian 12 and 13) HushMic registers the actions with Plasma's own shortcut service instead, and the entry opens System Settings on HushMic's page under Shortcuts, where you assign the keys. The Flatpak cannot reach that service: on Plasma 5 it has no shortcuts, and on Plasma 6.0 to 6.3 System Settings opens on each start once they are set up. Elsewhere this needs the GlobalShortcuts portal (Plasma 6.4 and later, GNOME 45 and later). Where it is missing, the entry stays hidden; bind the commands below in your desktop's shortcut settings instead. Starting HushMic from a terminal additionally needs xdg-desktop-portal 1.18 or newer so it can identify itself to the portal; app-menu and autostart launches do not.

## Command line

```text
hushmic status [--json]        what the running instance is doing
hushmic mode [STATE]           print or set: suppress | bypass | mute | off
hushmic toggle mute|bypass     enter the state, or leave it for the previous one
hushmic quit                   stop the running instance

hushmic config [--json]        every setting, one per line
hushmic config get KEY [--json]
hushmic config set KEY VALUE
hushmic config path
hushmic devices [--json]       microphones you can pass as `mic`
hushmic service install|uninstall   see headless.md
```

`status`, `mode`, `toggle` and `quit` talk to the running instance over a socket. Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 invalid usage or a failed command, 2 HushMic is not running. The `engine:` line in `status` (`quality model`, `light model`, `passthrough`; the JSON field `engine`) says which engine the chain is running right now: under CPU pressure HushMic falls back to the light model and climbs back later; automatic fallback never selects unfiltered audio, see [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md#latency-and-cpu).

`config set` applies the change immediately while HushMic runs and writes it to the file otherwise, with the same validation either way. `model` and `attn_limit` follow the menu's rule: `config get` shows the settings in effect and `config set` changes them where the menu would (the microphone's own settings, or the defaults). Without a running instance they refer to the microphone HushMic would start with. `status` names whose settings they are, for example `strength: 100 dB (RODE NT-USB profile)` or `(defaults)`; in `status --json`, `model` and `attn_limit` are the values in effect, `profile` is the node name of the microphone they belong to (`null` for the defaults), `defaults` holds the default `model` and `attn_limit`, and `inference` says what the running model runs on (`engine` is `native int8` or `onnx`, `reason` says why ONNX runs, `null` while nothing is reported). `config` and `config get` read the running instance's settings when there is one, else the file. `toggle mute` twice returns you to the state you came from, so one key can serve as a mute button.

## Configuration

The file is `~/.config/hushmic/config.toml` (`hushmic config path` prints the exact location). Set keys with `hushmic config set KEY VALUE`:

| key | values | default | applied |
|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| `mic` | a node name from `hushmic devices`, or `default` | `default` | live |
| `model` | `dpdfnet8_48khz_hr` or `dpdfnet2_48khz_hr`, for the settings in effect | `dpdfnet8_48khz_hr` | live, restarts the chain |
| `attn_limit` | 0 to 100 (dB), or `maximum`, `strong`, `medium`, `light`, for the settings in effect | `100` | live |
| `set_default` | `true` or `false`: make HushMic the system default input (a switch away by hand sticks until the next start or mode change) | `false` | live |
| `autostart` | `true` or `false`: desktop autostart entry | `false` | live |
| `tray` | `true` or `false`: register a tray icon | `true` | next start |
| `tray_icon` | `auto`, `color` or `symbolic`: which tray icon set to use | `auto` | live |
| `notifications` | `true` or `false`: desktop notifications | `true` | live |
| `inference` | `auto` or `onnx`: which engine runs the model | `auto` | live, restarts the chain |

Booleans also accept `on`/`off`, `yes`/`no` and `1`/`0`. `tray = false` hides the icon; a plain `hushmic` launch still opens the window, so use `--headless` when you want neither.

`tray_icon = auto` picks the monochrome icons on KDE and GNOME and the colored ones everywhere else, because those two desktops recolor a monochrome panel icon to match their theme. `color` and `symbolic` pin the choice if you prefer the other set. HushMic only names the icon it wants; the desktop draws it, so the monochrome one follows your panel from light to dark on its own. The change applies while HushMic runs, with no restart. `symbolic` on a desktop that does not recolor panel icons (LXQt, for example) can come out near-black on a dark panel, which is why `auto` leaves those on the colored set. If the monochrome files are not installed (an older package, a plain `cargo build`), the desktop falls back to the colored icon.

`inference = auto` runs the models on the native engine where the CPU supports it (x86-64 with AVX2 and FMA) and its weight files are installed, and on ONNX Runtime otherwise. `onnx` always uses ONNX Runtime. A change restarts the filter chain, which takes a moment. `hushmic status` shows the engine in use.

The file also holds `enabled` (set with `hushmic mode`), `mic_prefs` (model and strength per microphone) and `shortcuts_setup`, all managed by the app. The top-level `model` and `attn_limit` are the defaults for microphones without an entry in `mic_prefs`. `tray` and `notifications` are only written when false, `tray_icon` and `inference` when they are not `auto`, `mic_prefs` when non-empty and `shortcuts_setup` when true, so a file from an older version stays unchanged.

`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT` and `SIGHUP` all stop HushMic cleanly. There is no reload signal; use `hushmic config set`.
